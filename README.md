Welcome to the news_bot repository!

This is a bot designed to keep you updated on the latest news stories. The news_bot makes use of several Python libraries, including Requests, Beautiful Soup, and Time, to scrape news articles from various sources and deliver them to you in an easy-to-read format.

One of the interesting ways the code is written is through the use of regular expressions, which are used to extract specific pieces of information from the scraped HTML code. Additionally, the bot has been designed to run on a continuous loop, allowing it to scrape and deliver news updates at regular intervals.

The functionality of the news_bot is simple yet effective - it delivers news articles from a variety of sources straight to your inbox. You can customize which sources the bot scrapes from, and how often it delivers updates, to tailor your news experience to your preferences. Whether you're a news junkie or simply looking to stay informed, the news_bot has got you covered.

Thank you for visiting the news_bot repository, and we hope you find it useful!
